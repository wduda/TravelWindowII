## skills

I want to use the skills found in the `.skills` directory.

use the lotro-plugins-development-skill skill for work on the main project
use the git-commit skill for preparing git commit

## code style

when writing code, do not use ; to end lines as a convention

## changelog data style

when adding lines to changelog and changelogdata, the strings should have a prefix of either major: for major features, feat: for enhancements and minor features, fix: for changes which address behavior that was not as intended

## LOTRO Lua limits

utility classes found in turbine folder can be used but should be considered libraries we cannot change
