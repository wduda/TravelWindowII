Travel Window II
===================

LOTRO Interface Plugin

This is an interface plugin for the video game The Lord of the Rings Online. It creates a single UI window that contains all travel skills available to the character, including race, class, housing, and reputation skills. It is a fork and further development of the "Travel Window" plugin, that has been created by Dhor and worked on by multiple authors before.
