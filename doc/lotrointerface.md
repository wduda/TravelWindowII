This plugin creates a single window that contains available travel skills, including race, class, housing and reputation skills. It is a further development of the "Travel Window" plugin, that has been worked on by multiple authors before.

[B]Since this plugin is a 100% replacement for "Travel Window" you should not have both enabled at the same time. You can keep them both installed though.[/B]

The plugin has four modes of operation - icon grid, text list, pulldown list and carousel. These can be switched from the menu that opens when you right-click the plugin. This menu also gives you access to the options window.

This is a full plugin and can be installed standalone. Follow the general plugin installation instructions to install Travel Window II or update the install (depends on your OS).
I recommend you install and manage your plugins with the LOTRO Plugin Compendium found at this URL, since it will install plugins cleanly and take care of installing the Turbine utilities for you: [URL="http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html"]LOTRO Plugin Compendium App[/URL]

If you do not use Plugin Compendium, you need to manually install Turbine utilities that are available at:
[URL="http://content.turbine.com/sites/lotro/lua/Beta_LuaPlugins.7z"]http://content.turbine.com/sites/lotro/lua/Beta_LuaPlugins.7z[/URL]
This has to be extracted to your "Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins" folder (if you are on Windows) so two folders called Turbine and TurbinePlugins show up there.

[SIZE="3"]FAQ:[/SIZE]
How can I make a newly learned skill show up in Travel Window II?
These three options work:
[LIST]
[*] right-click anywhere on TW II, select "Check untrained skills" from the menu, the skill will show up
[*] open options window, go to Enable tab, click "Check untrained skills" button, the skill will show up
[*] relog the character
[/LIST]

Why does my racial skill show up even though I do not have the racial trait equipped?
[LIST]
[*]Because once the trait is acquired, it is classified as a "learned" skill by LOTRO itself, even though it is greyed out. Travel Window II, unfortunately, has no way of knowing if you have the racial trait equipped and the skill is usable. If you are not using the skill permanently, you can use the Enable/Disable options to hide it like any other skill.
[/LIST]

Why does a reputation or store version of my racial skill show up even though I have not obtained or bought it?
[LIST]
[*]This is because the racial and those store-bought skills have identical names ingame (i.e. "Return to Bree") and the plugin obtains a list of learned skills for your character that includes that particular name at least once. Based on that name alone the plugin cannot know which of the two skills you have obtained, while you can get both through the Racial+Store combo. You can use the Enable/Disable options to hide the skill you do not have that is greyed out.

How to handle the settings reset introduced by v1.0.7beta?
[LIST]
[*] if you had v1.0.6beta or earlier and update to v1.0.8beta or newer, you will keep your settings, but enable/disable and sorting will have to be reset - this is the best case where most settings can be kept
[*] if you updated to v.1.0.7beta but never logged that character in, an update to v1.0.8beta or newer will work as the above best case
[*] if you updated to v.1.0.7beta and logged that character in, you lost all settings, you now have two choices
[*]1. keep the settings you made manually after logging in with v1.0.7beta installed
[*]2. delete the TravelWindowII.plugindata file, and your settings from before will be imported by v1.0.8beta or newer, the same as the best-case scenario
[*]The file can be found at C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\PluginData\%ACCOUNTNAME%\%SERVERNAME%\%CHARACTERNAME%
