A new version is available!

v2.5.1

- enhance: added Ikorbani faction, adding rep level required for U42 skills
- enhance: adding some tokennames to DE and FR to start filling the acquisition tab
- enhance: open pull-down list upwards/downwards based on screen check so it does not go off screen
- fix: wrong label for Guide to Jirush

Help with further translations for DE, FR and RU clients is welcome. Ideally submitted as pull requests on GitHub, but any way can be accomodated really.
