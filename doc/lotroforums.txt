A new version is available!

v2.5.0

- enhance: U42 travel skills added for EN/FR/DE for all classes, with map coords, overlap settings and aquisition source
- enhance: removed no longer needed buttons and options menu for "Check Trained Skills" as TW II now reliably autodetects skill acquisition
- fix: Dol Amroth and Halrax now have correct coordinates on Haradwaith map for guide/muster/sail skills
- fix: Bej Magha skills will now be detected again after being renamed by SSG in U42

Help with further translations for DE, FR and RU clients is welcome. Ideally submitted as pull requests on GitHub, but any way can be accomodated really.
