This plugin creates a single window that contains available travel skills, including race, class, housing, and reputation skills.
The plugin has five modes of operation - icon grid, map view, text list, pulldown list and carousel. These can be switched from the menu that opens when you right-click the plugin.
This menu also gives you access to the options window. 

The plugin is a continuation of the "Travel Window" plugin, that has been worked on by multiple authors before.
[B]Since this plugin is a 100% replacement for "Travel Window" you should not have both enabled at the same time. You can keep them both installed though.[/B]

[SIZE="3"]Installation:[/SIZE]
This is a full plugin and can be installed standalone. Follow the general plugin installation instructions to install Travel Window II or update the install (depends on your OS).
I recommend you install and manage your plugins with the LOTRO Plugin Compendium found at this URL, since it will install plugins cleanly: [URL="http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html"]LOTRO Plugin Compendium App[/URL]

[SIZE="3"]FAQ:[/SIZE]
Why does my racial skill show up even though I do not have the racial trait equipped?
[LIST]
[*]Because once the trait is acquired, it is classified as a "learned" skill by LOTRO itself, even though it is greyed out. Travel Window II, unfortunately, has no way of knowing if you have the racial trait equipped and the skill is usable. If you are not using the skill permanently, you can use the Enable/Disable options to hide it like any other skill.
[/LIST]

Why are unlearned skills shown in Map View?
[LIST]
[*]The map view makes it easy to visually find known skills. The unlearned skills offer a chance to see what other travekl skills are not available. They can still be hidden using the enable feature.
[/LIST]

Why do I see both class skills and Return skills in Map View as Hunter/Mariner/Warden?
[LIST]
[*]Because they are all learned/unlearned skills. If you want to hide those with overlap (i.e. Guide to Bree and Return To Bree) use the Enable tab of the options. Disable overlapping will immediately hide all duplicates and prefer class skills.
[/LIST]

Why does the plugin crash on brand new Creep characters?
[LIST]
Those have zero travel skills. After completing the tutorial you obtain the first travel skill and the plugin will load.
[/LIST]

How do I use the Carousel mode?
[LIST]
Use the mousewheel while hovering over the travel skill icon to change the selected skill.
